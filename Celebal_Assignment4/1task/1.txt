1.Install Docker
   Installed Docker Desktop and verified installation using docker --version.
2.Pull an Image
   Pulled a sample image like hello-world from Docker Hub.
3.Run a Container
   Ran the image to check if Docker was working properly.
4.Check Running Containers
   Used docker ps to see active containers.
5.View All Containers
   Listed all containers (including stopped ones).
6.Stop and Remove Containers
  Stopped and removed unused containers for cleanup.
7.Remove Images
  Deleted images no longer needed to save space.
8.Run Ubuntu in Interactive Mode

9.Execute Basic Linux Commands
   	Inside the container, ran simple commands like ls, pwd.
10.Exit Container
