Task: Create a Docker Volume and Mount It to a Container

Steps:
1.Create a Docker Volume
  docker volume create myvolume
2.Verify the Volume
  docker volume ls
3.Run a Container with the Volume Mounted
  docker run -dit --name volcontainer -v myvolume:/app ubuntu
4.Add Data to the Volume
  docker exec -it volcontainer bash
  Created a file inside /app (the mount path).
5.Check Volume Persistence
  Stopped and removed the container, then re-attached the same volume to a new one.
  Verified that data in /app still existed, proving volume persistence.
6.Inspect Volume (Optional)
  docker volume inspect myvolume
