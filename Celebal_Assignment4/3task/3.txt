Task: Docker Registry, DockerHub, Create a Multi-Stage Build

Steps:
1.Install and Set Up Docker
  Install Docker Desktop or Docker Engine.
  Verify installation using docker --version.
2.Login to DockerHub
  Create an account at hub.docker.com.
  Use docker login to authenticate from the command line.
3.Pull an Image from DockerHub
   Use docker pull <image-name> to download a public image like nginx or ubuntu.
4.Create a Sample Application
  Prepare a simple project (e.g., a Node.js or static HTML app) that will be containerized.
5.Write a Multi-Stage Dockerfile
  Stage 1: Use a base image (like node) to build the app.
  Stage 2: Use a lightweight image (like nginx) to serve the built files.
  Use COPY --from=builder to move build artifacts from one stage to another.
6.Build the Docker Image
   Use docker build -t <image-name> . in the project directory.
7.Run the Container Locally

  Use docker run -p <host-port>:<container-port> <image-name> to test the image.

8.Tag the Image for DockerHub

  Use docker tag <image-name> <username>/<repository-name> to prepare for push.

9.Push the Image to DockerHub

  Use docker push <username>/<repository-name> to upload the image.

10.Verify on DockerHub

  Visit your DockerHub account to confirm the image was uploaded successfully.
